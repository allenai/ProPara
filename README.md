# EMNLP 2018 Update
Data and code related to our recent [EMNLP'18 paper] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10012) is released on 31st Oct 2018.
**Code contributors: Niket Tandon, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Joel Grus

Detailed instructions to train your own ProStruct model can be found in: EMNLP18-README.md

** Evaluation code for this task will soon be released on our public leaderboard: Link to appear soon....


# ProPara
The ProPara dataset is designed to train and test comprehension of simple paragraphs describing processes, e.g., photosynthesis. We treat the comprehension task as that of predicting, tracking, and answering questions about how entities change during the process.

This repository contains code following three neural models developed at Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
These models are built using the PyTorch-based deep-learning NLP library, [AllenNLP](http://allennlp.org/).

 * ProLocal: A simple local model that takes a sentence and entity as input and predicts state changes happening to the entity. 
 * ProGlobal: A global model for state change prediction that takes entire paragraph and an entity as input and predicts the entity's state at every time-step in the paragraph. 
 * ProStruct: A global model for state change prediction that incorporates commonsense to output most sensible predictions for the entire paragraph.

ProLocal and Proglobal are described in our NAACL'18 paper.
